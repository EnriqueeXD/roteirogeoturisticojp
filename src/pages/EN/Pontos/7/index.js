        <h2>Outcrop Of Gramame Formation</h2>
			<p className="text-article">EThis Place of Interest corresponds to an outcrop of the <b> Gramame Formation </b> limestone (Maastrichtiano) in the area of ​​the Intercement cement plant, former CIMPOR plant. In addition to its geological importance, the Engenho da Graça is present inside the factory, with the Capela da Graça, in addition to a marked biodiversity. It was also in its limits where, at the time of the city's founding, the village of the Guiragibe Indian, who had been catechized by the Jesuits, would have settled.</p>
			<p className="text-article">The Portuguese cement manufacturing company CIMPOR was installed in Ilha do Bispo in 1933, being one of the oldest factories in the country. In 2012, it was acquired by the Brazilian company Intercement. From an extractivist point of view, the area is divided into two mines: Mina da Graça, the oldest, from the 1930s and Mina Sampaio, from the 1960s, both of which have been stopped, due to the economic crisis that has settled in the country. Despite being a private property, the mines, together with Engenho da Graça, can be visited by the community, tourists and researchers, provided that by appointment and justification, the collection of samples or taking photographs is prohibited.</p>
			<p className="text-article">Stratigraphically, the limestone present is part of the <b> Gramame Formation </b>, of Maastrichtian age. Inside the factory, the top layer of the Graça mine corresponds to the floor of the Sampaio mine, which indicates that there was a fault with vertical tailings between them, filled with clay and without outcropping of limestone. In both mines, three facies can be identified that interleave continuously (photo 1a), in layers of great lateral extension and horizontal, being superimposed on the reddish sandstones of the <b> Barreiras Formation </b> (Plio-pleistocene age) . The upper facies are yellowish due to the more accentuated chemical weathering. Thin sheets of the three facies were made, described below.</p>

			<p className="text-article"><b>Facies i: </b> macroscopically, millimeter-sized pyrite crystals, ammonoid fossils (photo 1b), millimeter-centimeter geodes of calcite (indicating reprecipitation, photo 1c), pyritized coprolites and calcite nodules were found, as well as bioturbation structures. , in particular those caused by the icnogenus Thalassinoides isp. </p>

			<p className="text-article">In a thin layer, the rock is composed of 5% of grains and 95% of matrix, without pore identification. Among the grains, foraminifera bioclasts (Textularin), radiolaria and echinoderm fragments (photomicrograph 1a) are observed. In relation to the other grains, rhombohedral crystals of dolomite and opaque minerals are observed. Regarding the matrix, it is known that it is of the recrystallized micritic depositional type (due to the crystals of calcite and dolomite present in it, photomicrograph 1b). From this information, the rock was classified as Biomicrite (FOLK, 1962) or recrystallized Mudstone (DUNHAN, 1962). Given the interpretation of all aspects together, some diagenetic events were interpreted that follow the following chronological line: as a representative of Eodiagenesis, micritization (characteristic of a stagnant marine region); as an event of Mesodiagenesis we have incipient compaction, dolomitization of the matrix and bioclasts and the phosphating process. Finally, the presence of some very small grains of opaque material was observed, which was interpreted as the result of pyritization.</p>

			<p className="text-article"><b>Facies ii: </b> presents an incipient lamination with the naked eye. Highly fossiliferous, the rock is composed of 20% of grains and 80% of matrix, without pore identification. Among the grains, foraminifera (Globigerin and Textularin), fragments of echinoderms and chalcispheres (product of the activity of green algae, photomicrograph 2a) and radiolarians (photomicrograph 2b) were observed. In relation to the other grains, rhombohedral crystals of dolomite are observed. Regarding the matrix, it is known that it is of the recrystallized micritic depositional type. Sometimes, syntaxial cement is found. From this information, the rock was classified as Biomicrite (FOLK, 1962) or Packstone (DUNHAN, 1962). The diagenetic events are similar to those of facies i, except for the absence of phosphating processes.</p>

			<p className="text-article">Inside the factory area there is a biodiversity stronghold and an archaeological site that the company preserves. The biodiversity stronghold concerns a rich fauna and flora, with the presence of the only nest of white herons (photo 3a) existing in the municipality, whose eating habits were studied. This nest is found at Fazenda da Graça (photo 3b) and the studies counted on the participation of researchers from UFPB.</p>

			<p className="text-article">However, the long period of inactivity and the lack of adequate care left her in a precarious state of conservation. As it is a listed heritage, it cannot undergo any reform that does not respect its original elements and characteristics. The company counted, as allies, with technicians from the Workshop-school who, between 2009 and 2011, restored it, in order to add to the capital's natural and cultural heritage, already so rich in history and beauty.</p>
			<p className="text-article">The geological characteristics, combined with the Cultural Heritage, make it possible to confirm the Place of Interest as an important representative of the geodiversity of the Historic Center, therefore with potential for the practice of geotourism. Pereira and Pereira (2015) analyze the possibility, even, of the insertion of the industrial tourism activity in the factory, due to its rich history, added to the existence of an extraction process by means of heavy machinery and technology of transforming the limestone into cement. , which can be viewed in its different stages, which would bring benefits to all parties involved. </p>
