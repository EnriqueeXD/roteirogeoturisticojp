            In the geopatrimony of an area, in the form of rocky outcrops, with their minerals, fossils, structures and textures, in the soils, in the bodies of water, as well as in the great forms of relief or in the cultural heritage of a given Historical Center, they are inserted information that helps to tell the story of this place, its geodiversity and how geo-resources were used, in a given historical time, from a cultural point of view. Thus, Geosciences, culture and the history of the place where this information is inserted are combined.

            <p>The depredation of nature, due to the increase in consumption and inadequate economic and social practices, forces some sectors of the economy to adapt to conservation activities, both aimed at the biotic and abiotic environments. Geotourism also fits this context.</p>

            <p>João Pessoa and the coast of Paraíba, especially the south coast, by nature, is a tourist destination of ‘sun and sea’. In addition to the fact that it has a beautiful landscape, which intertwines these natural elements with a very rich history, whose beginnings are directly linked to this geopatrimony, it becomes necessary to link nature, history and culture to tourism, as this is the basis for environmental knowledge, the historical ties between nature and society are strengthened and the local economy is increased through a practice that is already ingrained, inserting new characters who were indirectly part of the system. In addition, sustainability is rooted in geotourism practices and the participation of a local community aware of this situation can generate an increase in income, whose abiotic heritage will serve as a new tourist attraction, and can boost areas with stagnant economy.</p>
