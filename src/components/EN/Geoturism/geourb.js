        <p>Urban geotourism manifests itself as an important area within geotourism. Like geotourism, it presents a restricted conceptual aspect (strictu sensu) and a broad one (lato sensu). In a restricted sense, when knowing and mapping cultural heritage, including churches, houses, cemeteries, monuments, paved roads, among others, when describing their architecture and history, identifying the belonging lithologies, characterizing them petrographically and, if necessary, possible, to identify its origin, measures can be proposed that encourage and guarantee its geoconservation and disseminate its geodiversity (PEREIRA et al., 2013b; PEREIRA and AMARAL, 2014). The abiotic natural heritage inserted in the urban area, such as quarries, parks with fresh water sources, waterfalls, specific landforms, among others, can also be part of urban geotouristic routes in this restricted sense.</p>
